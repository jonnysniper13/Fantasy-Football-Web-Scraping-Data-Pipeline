# Web-Scraping-Data-Pipeline
For this project, I've implemented an industry grade data collection pipeline that can run scalably in the cloud.

The pipeline collects all avaiable player data from the Premier League Fantasy Football website (https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) and stores it in individual json files within a local repository and on AWS S3. This pipeline is also containerised on Docker so that it can be ran remotely on AWS EC2.
